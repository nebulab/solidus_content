SolidusContent
==============

Introduction goes here.

Installation
------------

Add solidus_content to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_content'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bin/rails generate solidus_content:install
```

Usage
-----

Create an entry type for the home page:

```rb
home_entry_type = SolidusContent::EntryType.create!(
  name: :home,
  provider_name: :json,
  options: { path: 'data/home' }
)
```

Create a default entry for the home page:

```rb
home = SolidusContent.create!(
  content_type: home_entry_type,
  slug: :default,
)
```

And then write a file inside your app root under `data/home/default.json`:

```json
{"title":"Hello World!"}
```

### Within an existing view

Use the content inside an existing view, e.g. `app/views/spree/home/index.html.erb`:

```erb
<% data = SolidusContent::Entry.data_for(:home, :default) %>

<h1><%= data[:title] %></h1>
```

### With the default route

SolidusContent will add a default route that starts with `/c/`, by adding a view
inside `app/views/spree/solidus_content/` with the name of the entry type you'll
be able to render your content.

E.g. `app/views/spree/solidus_content/home.html.erb`:
```erb
<h1><%= data[:title] %></h1>
```

Then, visit `/c/home/default` or even just `/c/home` (when the content slug is
"default" it can be omitted).


### With a custom route

You can also define a custom route and use the SolidusContent controller to
render your content from a dedicated view:

```rb
# config/routes.rb
Spree::Core::Engine.routes.draw do
  # Will render app/views/spree/solidus_content/home.html.erb
  root to: 'solidus_content#show', type: :home, id: :default

  # Will render app/views/spree/solidus_content/info.html.erb
  get "privacy", to: 'solidus_content#show', type: :info, id: :privacy
  get "legal", to: 'solidus_content#show', type: :info, id: :legal

  # Will render app/views/spree/solidus_content/info.html.erb
  get "blog/:id", to: 'solidus_content#show', type: :post
end
```

Configuration
-------------

Configure SolidusContent in an initializer:

```rb
# config/initializers/solidus_content.rb

SolidusContent.configure do |config|
  # Your configuration goes here, please refer to the examples provided in the
  # initializer generated by `bin/rails g solidus_content:install`
end
```

Available Content Providers
---------------------------

### RAW

This is the most simple provider, its data will come directly from the entry
options.

```rb
posts = SolidusContent::EntryType.create(
  name: 'posts',
  provider_name: 'raw',
)
entry = SolidusContent::Entry.create(
  slug: '2020-03-27-hello-world',
  entry_type: posts,
  options: {title: "Hello World!", body: "My first post!"}
)
```

### JSON

Will fetch the data from a JSON file within the directory specified by the
`path` entry-type option and with a basename corresponding to the entry `slug`.

```rb
posts = SolidusContent::EntryType.create(
  name: 'posts',
  provider_name: 'json',
  options: {path: 'data/posts'}
)
entry = SolidusContent::Entry.create(
  slug: '2020-03-27-hello-world',
  entry_type: posts,
)
```

```jsonc
// [RAILS_ROOT]/data/posts/2020-03-27-hello-world.json
{"title": "Hello World!", "body": "My first post!"}
```

_NOTE: Absolute paths are taken as they are and won't be joined to `Rails.root`._

### YAML

Will fetch the data from a YAML file within the directory specified by the
`path` entry-type option and with a basename corresponding to the entry `slug`.

If there isn't a file with the `yml` extension, the `yaml` extension will be tried.

```rb
posts = SolidusContent::EntryType.create(
  name: 'posts',
  provider_name: 'yaml',
  options: {path: 'data/posts'}
)
entry = SolidusContent::Entry.create(
  slug: '2020-03-27-hello-world',
  entry_type: posts,
)
```

```yaml
# [RAILS_ROOT]/data/posts/2020-03-27-hello-world.yml

title: Hello World!
body: My first post!
```

_NOTE: Absolute paths are taken as they are and won't be joined to `Rails.root`._

### Solidus static content

To retrieve the page we have to pass the page `slug` to the entry options.
If the page slug is the same of the entry one, we can avoid passing the options.

```rb
posts = SolidusContent::EntryType.create(
  name: 'posts',
  provider_name: 'solidus_static_content'
)

entry = SolidusContent::Entry.create!(
  slug: '2020-03-27-hello-world',
  entry_type: posts,
  options: { slug: 'XXX' } # Can be omitted if the page slug is the same of the entry
)
```

_Be sure to have added `gem "solidus_static_content"` to your Gemfile._

### Contentful

To fetch the data we have to create a connection with Contentful passing the
`contentful_space_id` and the `contentful_access_token` to the entry-type options.

Will fetch the data from Contentful passing the `entry_id` entry option.

```rb
posts = SolidusContent::EntryType.create(
  name: 'posts',
  provider_name: 'contentful',
  options: {
    contentful_space_id: 'XXX',
    contentful_access_token: 'XXX'
  }
)

entry = SolidusContent::Entry.create!(
  slug: '2020-03-27-hello-world',
  entry_type: posts,
  options: { entry_id: 'XXX' }
)
```

_Be sure to have added `gem "contentful"` to your Gemfile._

### Prismic

To fetch the data we have to create a connection with Prismic passing the
`api_entry_point` to the entry-type options.

If the repository is private, you have to also pass the `api_token` to the entry-type options.

Will fetch the data from Prismic passing the `id` entry option.

```rb
posts = SolidusContent::EntryType.create(
  name: 'posts',
  provider_name: 'prismic',
  options: {
    api_entry_point: 'XXX',
    api_token: 'XXX' # Only if the repository is private
  }
)

entry = SolidusContent::Entry.create!(
  slug: '2020-03-27-hello-world',
  entry_type: posts,
  options: { id: 'XXX' }
)
```

_Be sure to have added `gem "prismic.io"` to your Gemfile._

### AlchemyCMS

Will fetch the data from an [AlchemyCMS](https://github.com/AlchemyCMS/alchemy_cms) page passing the `slug` entry option.

You can also filter the elements to include with the page by passing `only` and `except` with the `options` hash. _Note: It will return all elements from that page if omitted._

All element finder options are supported. Please have a look into [its documentation](https://github.com/AlchemyCMS/alchemy_cms/blob/master/lib/alchemy/elements_finder.rb) for available options.

```rb
pages = SolidusContent::EntryType.create(
  name: 'pages',
  provider_name: 'alchemy'
)

entry = SolidusContent::Entry.create!(
  slug: 'hello/world',
  entry_type: pages,
  options: { only: 'article' }
)
```

_Be sure to have `gem "alchemy_cms"` added to your `Gemfile`._

Registering a content provider
==============================

To register a content-provider, add a callable to the configuration under the
name you prefer. The

```rb
SolidusContent.config.register_provider :json, ->(input) {
  dir = Rails.root.join(input.dig(:type_options, :path))
  file = dir.join(input[:slug] + '.json')
  data = JSON.parse(file.read, symbolize_names: true)

  input.merge(data: data)
}
```

The `input` passed to the content-provider will have the following keys:

- `slug`: the slug of the content-entry
- `type`: the name of the content-type
- `provider`: the name of the content-provider
- `options`: the entry options
- `type_options`: the content-type options

The `output` of the content-provider is the `input` hash augmented with the
following keys:

- `data`: the content itself
- `provider_client`: (optional) the client of the external service
- `provider_entry`: (optional) the object retrieved from the external service

In both the input and output all keys should be symbolized.

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bin/rake
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_content/factories'
```

Releasing
---------

Your new extension version can be released using `gem-release` like this:

```shell
bundle exec gem bump -v VERSION --tag --push --remote upstream && gem release
```
