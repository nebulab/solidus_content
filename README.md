<!-- Explain what your extension does. -->

An extremely modular and extensible CMS for Solidus.

It can consume content from different sources such as Contentful, DatoCMS, Prismic.io or custom JSON, YAML and raw formats. It makes it super easy to render and customize any content.

## Installation

Add solidus_content to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_content'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bin/rails generate solidus_content:install
```

## Usage

<!-- Explain how to use your extension once it's been installed. -->

Create an entry type for the home page:

```rb
home_entry_type = SolidusContent::EntryType.create!(
  name: :home,
  provider_name: :json,
  options: { path: 'data/home' }
)
```

Create a default entry for the home page:

```rb
home = SolidusContent::Entry.create!(
  entry_type: home_entry_type,
  slug: :default,
)
```

And then write a file inside your app root under `data/home/default.json`:

```json
{"title":"Hello World!"}
```

### Within an existing view

Use the content inside an existing view, e.g. `app/views/spree/home/index.html.erb`:

```erb
<% data = SolidusContent::Entry.data_for(:home, 'default') %>

<h1><%= data[:title] %></h1>
```

### With the default route

SolidusContent will add a default route that starts with `/c/`, by adding a view
inside `app/views/spree/solidus_content/` with the name of the entry type you'll
be able to render your content.

E.g. `app/views/spree/solidus_content/home.html.erb`:

```erb
<h1><%= @entry.data[:title] %></h1>
```

Then, visit `/c/home/default` or even just `/c/home` (when the content slug is
"default" it can be omitted).

### With a custom route

You can also define a custom route in your `Application` routes file and use
the `SolidusContent` controller to render your content from a dedicated view:

```rb
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # Will render app/views/spree/solidus_content/home.html.erb
  root to: 'spree/solidus_content#show', type: :home, id: :default

  # Will render app/views/spree/solidus_content/info.html.erb
  get "privacy", to: 'spree/solidus_content#show', type: :info, id: :privacy
  get "legal", to: 'spree/solidus_content#show', type: :info, id: :legal

  # Will render app/views/spree/solidus_content/post.html.erb
  get "blog/:id", to: 'spree/solidus_content#show', type: :post

  mount Spree::Core::Engine, at: '/'
end
```

## Configuration

Configure SolidusContent in an initializer:

```rb
# config/initializers/solidus_content.rb

SolidusContent.configure do |config|
  # Your configuration goes here, please refer to the examples provided in the
  # initializer generated by `bin/rails g solidus_content:install`
end
```

## Available Content Providers

### RAW

This is the most simple provider, its data will come directly from the entry
options.

```rb
posts = SolidusContent::EntryType.create(
  name: 'posts',
  provider_name: 'raw',
)
entry = SolidusContent::Entry.create(
  slug: '2020-03-27-hello-world',
  entry_type: posts,
  options: { title: "Hello World!", body: "My first post!" }
)
```

### JSON

Will fetch the data from a JSON file within the directory specified by the
`path` entry-type option and with a basename corresponding to the entry `slug`.

```rb
posts = SolidusContent::EntryType.create(
  name: 'posts',
  provider_name: 'json',
  options: { path: 'data/posts' }
)
entry = SolidusContent::Entry.create(
  slug: '2020-03-27-hello-world',
  entry_type: posts,
)
```

```jsonc
// [RAILS_ROOT]/data/posts/2020-03-27-hello-world.json
{"title": "Hello World!", "body": "My first post!"}
```

_NOTE: Absolute paths are taken as they are and won't be joined to `Rails.root`._

### YAML

Will fetch the data from a YAML file within the directory specified by the
`path` entry-type option and with a basename corresponding to the entry `slug`.

If there isn't a file with the `yml` extension, the `yaml` extension will be tried.

```rb
posts = SolidusContent::EntryType.create(
  name: 'posts',
  provider_name: 'yaml',
  options: { path: 'data/posts' }
)
entry = SolidusContent::Entry.create(
  slug: '2020-03-27-hello-world',
  entry_type: posts,
)
```

```yaml
# [RAILS_ROOT]/data/posts/2020-03-27-hello-world.yml

title: Hello World!
body: My first post!
```

_NOTE: Absolute paths are taken as they are and won't be joined to `Rails.root`._

### Solidus static content

To retrieve the page we have to pass the page `slug` to the entry options.
If the page slug is the same of the entry one, we can avoid passing the options.

```rb
posts = SolidusContent::EntryType.create(
  name: 'posts',
  provider_name: 'solidus_static_content'
)

entry = SolidusContent::Entry.create!(
  slug: '2020-03-27-hello-world',
  entry_type: posts,
  options: { slug: 'XXX' } # Can be omitted if the page slug is the same of the entry
)
```

_Be sure to have added `gem "solidus_static_content"` to your Gemfile._

### Contentful

To fetch the data we have to create a connection with Contentful passing the
`contentful_space_id` and the `contentful_access_token` to the entry-type options.

Will fetch the data from Contentful passing the `entry_id` entry option.

```rb
posts = SolidusContent::EntryType.create(
  name: 'posts',
  provider_name: 'contentful',
  options: {
    contentful_space_id: 'XXX',
    contentful_access_token: 'XXX'
  }
)

entry = SolidusContent::Entry.create!(
  slug: '2020-03-27-hello-world',
  entry_type: posts,
  options: { entry_id: 'XXX' }
)
```

_Be sure to have added `gem "contentful"` to your Gemfile._

### DatoCMS

To fetch the data we have to create a connection with DatoCMS passing the
`api_token` to the entry-type options.

```rb
posts = SolidusContent::EntryType.create(
  name: 'posts',
  provider_name: 'datocms',
  options: {
    api_token: 'XXX'
  }
)
```

If we need to work on a sandbox environment, add the `environment` option:

```rb
posts = SolidusContent::EntryType.create(
  name: 'posts',
  provider_name: 'datocms',
  options: {
    api_token: 'XXX',
    environment: 'my-sandbox'
  }
)
```

Will fetch the data from DatoCMS passing the `item_id` entry option:

```rb
entry = SolidusContent::Entry.create!(
  slug: '2020-03-27-hello-world',
  entry_type: posts,
  options: { item_id: 'XXX', version: 'published' }
)
```

If we want to retrieve the latest available version of the record instead of the currently published version, remove the `version` option:

```rb
entry = SolidusContent::Entry.create!(
  slug: '2020-03-27-hello-world',
  entry_type: posts,
  options: { item_id: 'XXX' }
)
```

_Be sure to have added `gem "dato"` to your Gemfile._

### Prismic

To fetch the data we have to create a connection with Prismic passing the
`api_entry_point` to the entry-type options.

If the repository is private, you have to also pass the `api_token` to the entry-type options.

Will fetch the data from Prismic passing the `id` entry option.

```rb
posts = SolidusContent::EntryType.create(
  name: 'posts',
  provider_name: 'prismic',
  options: {
    api_entry_point: 'XXX',
    api_token: 'XXX' # Only if the repository is private
  }
)

entry = SolidusContent::Entry.create!(
  slug: '2020-03-27-hello-world',
  entry_type: posts,
  options: { id: 'XXX' }
)
```

_Be sure to have added `gem "prismic.io"` to your Gemfile._

### Registering a content provider

To register a content-provider, add a callable to the configuration under the
name you prefer. The

```rb
SolidusContent.config.register_provider :json, ->(input) {
  dir = Rails.root.join(input.dig(:type_options, :path))
  file = dir.join(input[:slug] + '.json')
  data = JSON.parse(file.read, symbolize_names: true)

  input.merge(data: data)
}
```

The `input` passed to the content-provider will have the following keys:

- `slug`: the slug of the content-entry
- `type`: the name of the content-type
- `provider`: the name of the content-provider
- `options`: the entry options
- `type_options`: the content-type options

The `output` of the content-provider is the `input` hash augmented with the
following keys:

- `data`: the content itself
- `provider_client`: (optional) the client of the external service
- `provider_entry`: (optional) the object retrieved from the external service

In both the input and output all keys should be symbolized.

## Connecting Webhooks

Many content providers such as Contentful or Prismic can send payloads via webhooks when content changes, those can be very useful in a number of ways.

We suggest using the [`solidus_webhooks`](http://github.com/solidusio-contrib/solidus_webhooks#readme) extension to get the most out of `solidus_content`, let's see some examples.

Add this to your Gemfile:

```rb
gem "solidus_webhooks"
```

### Using Webhooks to Auto-Create entries

In this example we setup a webhook that will create or update Contentful entries whenever they're changed or created.

```rb
# config/initializers/webhooks.rb

SolidusWebhooks.config.register_webhook_handler :contentful, -> payload {
  next unless payload.dig(:sys, :Type) == "Entry"
  entry_type = SolidusContent::EntryType.find_or_create_by(
    name: payload.dig(:sys, :ContentType, :sys, :id),
    provider_name: :raw
  )
  entry = entry_type.entries.find_or_initialize_by(slug: payload.dig(:sys, :id))
  entry.options = payload.fetch(:fields)
}
```

### Using Webhooks to expire caches

When caching the content of `app/views/spree/home/index.html.erb` as in this example:

```erb
<% cache(@entry) do %>
  <h1><%= @entry.data[:title] %></h1>
<% end %>
```

You may want to setup a webhook that will touch the entry every time it's modified:

```rb
# config/initializers/webhooks.rb

SolidusWebhooks.config.register_webhook_handler :prismic, -> payload {
  prismic_entry_types = SolidusContent::EntryType.where(provider_name: :prismic)

  # Prismic doesn't give much informations about which entries have been changed,
  # so we're touching them all.
  SolidusContent::Entry.where(entry_type: prismic_entry_types).touch_all
}
```

*NOTE: `touch_all` was introduced in Rails 6, for earlier versions use `find_each(&:touch)`.*

## Development

### Testing the extension

First bundle your dependencies, then run `bin/rake`. `bin/rake` will default to building the dummy
app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using
`bin/rake extension:test_app`.

```shell
bin/rake
```

To run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis run

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_content/factories'
```

### Running the sandbox

To run this extension in a sandboxed Solidus application, you can run `bin/sandbox`. The path for
the sandbox app is `./sandbox` and `bin/rails` will forward any Rails commands to
`sandbox/bin/rails`.

Here's an example:

```
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

### Updating the changelog

Before and after releases the changelog should be updated to reflect the up-to-date status of
the project:

```shell
bin/rake changelog
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Update the changelog"
```

### Releasing new versions
